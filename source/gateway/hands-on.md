# AWS Storage Gateway Hands-on

Yet to be done. Currently the resources at my disposal do not meet [Hardware requirements for the Storage Gateway VM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/Requirements.html), which demands:

## Software

- VMware ESXi Hypervisor (version 4.1 or 5.0).
- Or, Microsoft Hyper-V 2008 R2.

## Hardware

- Four or eight virtual processors assigned to the VM.
- 7.5 GB of RAM assigned to the VM
- 75 GB of disk space for installation of VM image and system data
