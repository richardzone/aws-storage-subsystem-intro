# EBS Performance

It's better to use EBS-Optimized EC2 Instances with EBS when you're optimizing performance.

## Pre-Warming EBS Volumes

- 5 to 50 percent loss of IOPS for your volume the first time each block is accessed
- AWS suggests for most applications, amortizing this cost over the lifetime of the volume is acceptable.
- Details can be found at [Pre-Warming Amazon EBS Volumes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-prewarm.html)

## EBS IOPS Charactistics

- IOPS are input/output operations per second.
- I/O operations larger than 256 KB are counted in 256 KB capacity units.
- Volume Throughtput Limit: 128MB/s

## Create EBS Volumn from snapshots

- New volumes are created lazily in background, and can be used RIGHT AWAY
- If your instance accesses a piece of data that hasn't yet been loaded, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and then continues loading the rest of the volumeâ€™s data in the background.
