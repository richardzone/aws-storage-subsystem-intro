This quick guide book is created for one of the DevOps sessions we held at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/), and it makes extensive use of info from [AWS Official Site and Docs](http://aws.amazon.com/).

Note that this guide does not cover Amazon S3 which we'll talk about in another session.

We're using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) to generate our guide.
